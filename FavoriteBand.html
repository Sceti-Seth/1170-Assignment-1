    <h1>Joywave</h1>
    <p>My favorite band is Joywave. It has been my favorite band for almost 6 years. The band has an official website, click <a href="https://joywavemusic.com/">here</a> to go to it. Another band that I like that also has a website is Charming Liars. You can click <a href="https://www.charmingliars.com/">here</a> to visit it. I didn't discover them until the summer of 2023, but they've quickly become one of my favorite bands.</p>

    <p>This is the audio for my favorite song Blastoffff. It's by Joywave and was the first song I ever heard from them. It has been my favorite song since I first heard it in 2018.</p>
